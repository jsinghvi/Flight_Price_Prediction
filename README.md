# Flight_Price_Prediction

My solution to the flight price prediction hackathon using Decision Trees and other variants of it (AdaBoosted, Bagging Regressors etc).

## Results on Test Dataset
The model achieved an accuracy of 91.37154% on the test data, which although wasn't publicly available for me to try on, but you could always test the model accuracy using cross validation dataset (obtained from the training dataset itself).
